## Registers

    const device_description: string @ 0x180

Identifies the type of hardware (eg., ACME Corp. Servo X-42 Rev C)

    const device_class: u32 { min = 0x3000_0000, max = 0x3fff_ffff } @ 0x181

A numeric code for the string above; used to identify firmware images.

    const bootloader_device_class: u32 { min = 0x3000_0000, max = 0x3fff_ffff } @ 0x184

Typically the same as `device_class` unless device was flashed by hand; the bootloader will respond to that code.

    const firmware_version: string @ 0x185

A string describing firmware version; typically semver.

    ro temperature: i16 C { min = -10, max = 150 } @ 0x182

MCU temperature in degrees Celsius (approximate).

    ro uptime: u64 us @ 0x186

Number of microseconds since boot.
