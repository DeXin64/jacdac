# Overview

What follows is a short operational specification for JACDAC v1.
The main changes with respect to [JACDAC v0](https://jacdac.org/specification/) are:

* there is only one baud-rate supported (1Mbit)
* frame starts (as it did) and ends (new) with a UART break "character";
  the break at the end typically generates an interrupt that can be used to shut down DMA transfer
* all packets include full 64 bit identifier of either source of destination;
  the 8 bit compressed address is gone, and so it address allocation
* CRC fixed to be CRC-16-CCITT
* announce packets now contain only service classes; device name is gone and
  advertisement data can be queried from the service
* all packets include standardized 16-bit command, plus any custom data
* a protocol-level light-weight acknowledge mechanism is introduced
* several packets sharing device identifier can be sent in one physical frame

cases etc.
