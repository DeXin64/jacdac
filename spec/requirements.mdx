# Requirements

MCUs implementing JACDAC typically need the following:
* a UART module
* DMA for said UART (if device does nothing but JACDAC, it may be fine to skip this)
* some source of randomness; can be ADC of a floating input or internal temperature sensor

It is possible not to use DMA, if the MCU isn't doing anything else (eg., our bootloader
implementations doesn't use DMA nor interrupts).

It's important that devices don't come up with the same "random" numbers every time
they power on, and critical that two instances of the same device don't that.
Typically, you can take temperature readings a couple thousand times (they will fluctuate slightly),
hash the results and use that as a random seed.
Other option is a floating ADC.
Yet another is timing pin capacitance.
Initial contents of RAM does not appear to be random, despite the fact that it may look like it is.
