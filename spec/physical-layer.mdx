# Physical layer

Communication is done over a single line, using UART peripheral running at 1MHz,
8 bit per byte, no parity, 1 stop bit, LSB first (standard).
The line is held high when idle with either internal or external pull up of
around 20-50kÎ© per device.

## Reception

Normally, devices are set up to trigger an interrupt on line going low, with UART disabled.
When the line goes low, the device performs the following steps:
* zero-out header of the packet to be received
* wait for line going high again
* setup a UART in receive mode
* start reception
* setup a timer for 100us (TODO)
* when the timer fires, if the header is still all zero, signal timeout and abort reception
* otherwise, given that the header declares size to be `N`, setup timer for `(N + 16) * 12 + 60` (and don't touch reception)
* if UART break is detected, abort reception, abort the timer and process incoming packet (see below)
* if timer fires, signal timeout and abort reception
* setup line as input with pull up and reception interrupt
* possibly, start transmission timer (see below)

## Processing incoming packets

We arrive here when a UART break was detected.

* optionally, check if at least `N + 16` bytes was received;
  this may be difficult depending on DMA hardware, so can be skipped
* compute CRC of bytes `2` until `N + 16` of data;
  if it doesn't match the CRC in the first two bytes, signal error and stop processing this packet
* do control layer processing of packet (next section)

## Transmission

Devices should maintain a queue of packets to send.
When either transmission or reception finishes, and the queue is non-empty
the device should set up a timer for a random period roughly between 100us and 200us.
If this timer fires before any reception starts, the device can start
transmitting as described here.

* disable reception interrupt
* if we are already in reception abort transmission
* as quickly as possible, probe the line and if it's high, pull it low
* if the line was low, abort transmission and start reception as if the reception interrupt triggered
* wait ~10us
* pull the line high
* wait ~40us
* configure UART for transmission and start it
* when transmission ends:
* disable UART
* pull the line high
* pull it low
* wait ~10us
* pull the line high
* setup line as input with pull up and reception interrupt
* possibly, start transmission timer (see above)

Wait times need to be determined experimentally, so that the following are observed:
* initial low pulse is 11-15us
* the gap between end of low pulse and start of UART transmission is 40-50us (TODO)
* spacing between characters in UART transmission should be never more than 9us,
  and on average less than 2us
* the gap after UART transmission and before final break is less than 10us
* the final break is 11-15us

The probe-and-pull operation can typically be performed in a few cycles
and is critical to do as quick as possible.
The time difference between probe and set is the collision window of the protocol.
This can be typically brought down to around 50-100ns depending on MCU speed and GPIO hardware.
Typically, you'll want to add a function that is forced to be non-inline
and takes all arguments it needs pre-computed (GPIO port address, pin mask etc.).
It's good idea to look at disassembly of that function.

Such collision window cause about 0.3% packet loss when two devices try to
write on the bus as quickly as possible.
The packet loss grows quadratically with number of devices, but typically
devices do not flood the bus, which results in much lower packet losses.
