# JACDAC Specification

**JACDAC** (**J**oint **A**synchronous **C**ommunications; **D**evice **A**gnostic **C**ontrol) is a single wire broadcast protocol 
for the plug and play of microcontrollers (MCUs) within the contexts of rapid prototyping, 
making, and physical computing.

JACDAC operates in a bus topology and requires devices have a microcontroller with UART, Timer, and GPIO interrupt capabilities.

## History

The specification is hosted at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac.

## Frames

![An image depicting a JACDAC transmission. A JACDAC transmission begins with a start pulse of 11-14 us, a inter lo data spacing of minimally 40 us before data commences. A JACDAC transmission ends with an end pulse of 11-14 us.](./images/jacdac-activity.png)

The previous sections have discussed line signalling of a frame but there has been little discussion around how the data portion of a frame is organised.

The data portion of a JACDAC frame has the following layout in memory:

```c
struct _jd_frame_t {
    uint16_t frame_crc;
    uint8_t frame_size;
    uint8_t frame_flags;
    uint64_t device_identifier;
    uint8_t data[240]; // maximum
} __attribute__((__packed__, aligned(4)));
typedef struct _jd_frame_t jd_frame_t;
```

On the wire, the frame must be transmitted in little endian format (i.e. low byte of `frame_crc` first). The total maximum frame size is 252 bytes, selected to keep the total size of packet under `255` (the DMA limit on some hardware)and aligned to 4. The following table defines the meaning and size of the fields in the structure above.

| Memory offset | Field size (bytes) 	| Field name 	| Description  	|
|--------|------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| 0 | 2          	|`frame_crc`	| [16-bit CRC CCITT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) of all following fields. |
| 2 | 1          	|`frame_size`	| Size of the data field.	|
| 3 | 1          	|`frame_flags`	| Flags specific to this frame.	|
| 4 | 8          	|`device_identifier`	| 64-bit device identifier.	|
| 12 | 1 * `frame_size `  	|`data`	| The data payload of the frame.	|

### Frame flags

The `frame_flags` field is used to indicate

| Bit position | Bit name 	| Description 	|
|--------|------------	|-------------
| 0 | COMMAND	| Determines if the frame contains command or report packets. If set, the frame contains command packets, if not set, the frame contains report packets. 	|
| 1 | ACK_REQUESTED	| Determines if the receiver should return an ACK to the sender. If set, the receiver should repsond with an ACK frame, if not set, no response is required. 	|
| 2 | DEVICE_ID_ALT_MEANING	|  	|
| 3-7 | RESERVED	| Reserved for future use.	|

### Device identifiers

Each device is assigned a 64-bit device identifier that uniquely identifies it on the bus. This identifier is used in frames to determine the sending or receiving device, and for devices to remember one another on the bus. Device identifiers are generated, not allocated, and once generated a device's identifier must remain constant.

Device identifiers are not guaranteed to be universally unique, but there is little chance of users encountering identifier colision so long as identifiers are generated with appropriate entropy. We recommend the following ways of generating a unique identifier:

1. Use the random number generator embedded in this page to allocate an identifier for each device. The number generator could even be included into automated flashing processes to ensure appropriate entropy.

2. Use the random number generator embedded in this page to seed a hardware random number generator. The hardware random number generator could use sensor values to create further entropy.


## Packets

The data portion of a JACDAC frame is also structured and is internally divided into 1 or more packets. __Zero length frames are not supported__.

Each packet has the following layout in memory:

```c
struct _jd_packet_t {
    uint8_t packet_size;
    uint8_t service_instance;
    uint16_t service_command;
    uint8_t payload[236];
} __attribute__((__packed__, aligned(4)));
typedef struct _jd_packet_t jd_packet_t;
```

The following table defines the meaning and size of the fields in the structure above. The meaning of these fields will become clearer later on in this document.

| Memory offset | Field size (bytes) 	| Field name 	| Description  	|
|--------|------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| 12 | 1	|`packet_size`	| The size of the payload field. Maximum size is 236 bytes. |
| 13 | 1	|`service_instance`	| The instance number of the destination service.	|
| 14 | 2	|`service_command`	| A number that specifies an operation and code combination.	|
| 16 | 1 * `packet_size`	|`payload`	| The packet data payload destined for a particular service.	|

Packets are placed back-to-back inside the frame `data` field and must be padded so they start at a 4 byte boundary (i.e. `packet_size` is divisible by 4). Logically, packets placed in the same frame all share the same frame fields and thus the same `device_identifier`. This means only one device can be addressed in a single frame.

## Physical Layer

For communication JACDAC SWS reuses the often forgotten RS232 (UART) peripheral, common to many microcontrollers. Devices operate the UART peripheral in half-duplex mode and are connected together to form a single bus. This bus requires a common data and ground line to be shared between devices.

Like with standard UART, a logical one is represented as 3.3V and a logical 0 as 0V. Data bytes are 10 bits long and are composed of 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. JACDAC devices must only communicate at 1 Mbaud and when no data is being transmitted, the bus must read as a logical one (3.3V).

In JACDAC SWS, any device can initiate a transmission at any time. Because of this, devices must assert control over the bus before sending any data. This is where JACDAC differs from half-duplex UART–––devices must assert control over the bus by pulsing the line low before transmitting any data. This low pulse is known as the start pulse and must be between 11 and 15 microseconds in duration. This duration is recognised as a break condition on most UART hardware.

When the start pulse is over, devices have minimally 40 microseconds to configure IO registers to receive UART data. If no data byte is received within 100 microseconds, an error condition must be triggered and devices must wait for the bus to return to an idle state. This means that the first data byte must commence at 89 microseconds after the completion of the start pulse in order to be specification compliant.

After the transmitter has sent the data portion of a frame, it must then pulse the line low one final time to signal the end of a transmission. The duration of this end pulse is between 11 and 15 microseconds so to trigger another UART break condition. The end pulse can come immediately after the last data byte, but it must occur within 80 microseconds of the last data byte. If it does not, an error condition is generated.

A small amount of time must pass before another transmission can begin. Devices must wait minimally 100 microseconds plus a randomly generated backoff value so that multiple devices do not initiate transmission at precisely the same time. It is therefore extremely important that all devices have some randomness in their transmission sequence to reduce the likelihood of data loss.

A complete JACDAC transmission and the beginning of another are captured in the image below.

![An image depicting a JACDAC transmission. A JACDAC transmission begins with a start pulse of 11-14 us, a inter lo data spacing of minimally 40 us before data commences. A JACDAC transmission ends with an end pulse of 11-14 us.](./images/jacdac-activity.png)

### Hardware requirements

There is no silicon implementation of JACDAC SWS and a microcontroller is currently required to implement the behaviour above. The diversity of microcontrollers and the flexibility of UART hardware means that there are many pathways to reaching a specification compliant JACDAC SWS implementation.

To recap, JACDAC SWS requires the following basic functionality:

* Transmitting / receiving UART-style (10 bits: 1 byte, 1 stop bit, 1 start bit) bytes at 1Mbaud in half-duplex mode (implemented in hardware or in software via bit-banging).
* A GPIO with an internal or external 300k pull up and support for interrupts (implemented in hardware or in software by spin waiting).
* The ability to keep time (whether through instruction counting or a hardware timer).
* The ability to generate random numbers (or at least seed a software random number generator).

<!--
We enumerate a few of the options we have explored below.

#### 32-bit ARM processors

Many ARM processors come with DMA-able (Direct Memory Access) UART peripherals. This means that no CPU intervention is required to send or receive UART data. Many of these processors also support half-duplex mode and internally tie RX to TX together when this mode is selected. For microcontrollers that do not support internal ties, these pins can usually be connected to each other externally for the same effect. Internal pull ups and timers often also come built into this class of microcontroller.

JACDAC has been implemented on the following 32-bit ARM processors:

* Atmel SAMD21, SAMD51
* Nordic NRF52832, NRF52833, NRF52840
* STM 32F0, 32F1, 32F4

#### 8-bit processors

8-bit processors are typically not as capable as 32-bit ARM processors, but they are often cheaper. Throughout the design of JACDAC we have considered this class of processor and have implemented JACDAC on 8-bit processors with and without UART support. Through a software UART implementation via the PADAUK PMS150C, JACDAC can be added to any sensor at the cost of 2.5 US cents.-->

### Transmission sequence

1. Place GPIO in high impedence input mode.
2. Check to see if the line is low.
   - If the line is already low, start the reception sequence instead.
3. Place GPIO pin in output mode
4. Pulse the line low for 11––15 microseconds.
5. Configure the UART peripheral with the correct baud rate and begin transmitting data after (minimally) 40 microseconds.


### Reception sequence

1. Place GPIO in high impedence input mode with a PullUp.
2. Enable GPIO edge interrupts, UART break interrupts, or spin wait until the line goes low.
3. When the start pulse has finished, configure UART registers appropriately. It is better to wait until the start pulse is complete as in some cases UART hardware may incorrectly detect a data byte or trigger an error condition.
4. Receive data until the end pulse is detected.

### Error detection

The image and table below captures key timings of JACDAC SWS.

![An image depicting a JACDAC transmission with portions of the signal labelled, A-F.](./images/jacdac-proto-timings.png)

| Identifier 	| Name 	| Duration min/max (us) 	|
|------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| A          	|Start pulse	|11/15	|
| B          	|Start-data gap	|40/89	|
| C          	|Data-byte gap	|0/80	|
| D          	|Data-end gap	|0/80	|
| E          	|End pulse	|11/15	|
| F          	|Frame-to-frame gap	|100/	|

The state machine below encapsulates how these timings should be used during frame reception:

![An image depicting the state machine to be used when receiving a JACDAC packet. Whenever any timing is exceeded, the device should wait for the frame-to-frame gap to elapse before listening for another packet.](./images/jacdac-state-diagram.png)

## Service layer

The way JACDAC devices share resources with other devices on the bus are through __services__. Services provide abstract, standardised interfaces that can be used to interact with physical hardware resources (e.g. an accelerometer) or pure virtual resources (e.g. state of a video game). This abstraction brings plug-and-play dynamicity to JACDAC so that devices with different hardware, but the same overall functionality, can replace one another without having to recompile user applications. For example, two different  models of accelerometer hardware can replace each other because they share the same software interface.

Services act on __commands__ and optionally respond with __reports__. Reports can also be emitted separately from a service without prompting from another device. This interface is specified in a custom markdown language that lists the possible commands and reports a service can consume and emit. Specifications can also inherit from other specifications. A great example of this can be seen in the [sensor specification](../services/_sensor.md). JACDAC sensors inherit commands and reports from this specification, creating a set of base functionality for _all_ sensors.

### Commands

Commands are 16-bit and specified in the `service_command` field of a JACDAC packet. A command is composed of a 4-bit operation and a 12-bit code.

The operation is stored in the top most nibble of the `service_command` field. The following table below outlines all possible operations; XXX represents any 12-bit command code:

| Operation number | Command 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x0XXX` | Action	|
| `0x1XXX` | Register read	|
| `0x2XXX` | Register write	|
| `0x3XXX`- `0xfXXX` | Reserved	|

#### Actions

Actions are a type of command that cause a service to begin to carry out a task. An example action might be to calibrate a magnetometer.

Services can freely allocate their own action command codes in the following range:

| Action code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x080-0xeff` | Service defined action command codes 	|

However, services __must not__ allocate any of the common or reserved action command codes specified in the table below:

| Action code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x000-0x07f` | Common action command codes	|
| `0xf00-0xfff` | Reserved action command codes	|

Common action command codes are allocated in the [base specification](../services/_base.md).

#### Registers

Registers are properties that represent the state of a service.  Registers are variable length and are between 1 byte and 236 bytes (max payload) in size. Sequential register codes do not overlap with one another. For example, it is possible to have register `0x090` of size `12` and non-overlapping register `0x091` of size `4`.

Registers can be accessed and modified by register read (`0x1XXX`) and register write (`0x2XXX`) operations. Registers can be specified to be read-only or read-write capable. Trying to write to a read-only register will result in a nop (no operation). Because registers can have different access attributes they are segmented into different command code ranges.

Register command codes can be freely allocated in the following ranges:

| Register code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x080-0x0ff` | Read-write register codes specific to a service	|
| `0x180-0x1ff` | Read-only register codes specific to a service	|
| `0x280-0x2ff` | Additional register codes specific to a service. Should generally be avoided.	|

However, services __must not__ allocate any of the common or reserved register command codes specified in the table below:

| Register code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x001-0x07f` | Read-write registers common to all services	|
| `0x100-0x17f` | Read-only registers common to all services	|
| `0xf00-0xfff` | Reserved for future use.	|

Common register command codes are allocated in the [base specification](../services/_base.md).


#### Reports

Reports are packets sent by a service as a response to a command. They can also be used to independently broadcast important information such as events.

Layout of a report changes depending on its end purpose. __Register reports__ must always contain the register values requested in the original command packet, but for actions, the format is left up to the service creator to define. __Actions reports__ can either contain a pre-determined number of bytes as defined in the service specification or bear no operation.

A third type of report is an __Event__. Events are emitted independently by a service without prompting by a device. Some services may offer an interface to configure which events are emitted. Unlike prior types of report, event reports have a fixed format:
(TODO: this is not true; these fields are 4 bytes)

| Memory offset | Field size (bytes) 	| Field name 	| Description  	|
|--------|------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| 16 | 2	|`event_id`	| A number that uniquely identifies an event. |
| 18 | 2	|`event_argument`	| An optional argument that can provide additional context.	|

Event reports are sent in the same way as any other packet, and `device_identifier`, `service_instance`, and `service_command` differentiate it from other types of reports. These differentiators provide a unique namespace for each service. Multiple event reports can be placed back-to-back inside a single packet as long as their `event_id` pertains to the same service. For example, a button can emit `UP` and `HOLD` events in the same packet.
(TODO: this is actually handled by multiple packets in frame)

### The control service

The design of the physical layer accommodates dynamic connectivity, services bring hardware abstraction, but the control service is responsible for dynamic device discovery. To achieve this, the control service emits advertisement packets roughly every 500 milliseconds. Each advertisement packet contains a list of host services offered by a device; other devices on the bus can inspect these advertisements and subsequently communicate with the advertised services to incorporate them in user applications.

The control service also offers a set of common commands that can be used to query/inspect each JACDAC device. For example, the `IDENTIFY` command causes a JACDAC device to perform an action that allows a user to locate a particular device, usually through blinking an LED. In addition to emiting an advertisement packet every 500 milliseconds, a device that hosts one or more services must respond to all commands listed in the [control service specification](../services/control.md).

Implementation complexity of the control service scales with respect to the number of services a device implements. For instance, it is very simple to process packets for a single user service (in addition to the control service), but complexity increases as more services are added. This flexibility is a benefit as it allows ultra low-cost microcontrollers to be used in simple devices.


# TODO beyond this point.
## Control layer

Every JACDAC device has a unique 64 bit identifier.
It may be generated from hardware unique ID (through hashing if needed;
we recommend [FNV1A](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-eastlake-fnv-14#section-3)).
Alternatively, it may be generated at first run using randomness and stored in flash or EPROM.

Another option is to flash a randomly generated 64 bit number during production.
If that is difficult, generate 48 bit (or so) random number, and assign identifiers
starting with that number with lowest bits incrementing.
Make sure to machine-generate the number, do not just bang on the keyboard.
You can use the widget below to generate a random device identifier.

<RandomGenerator device={true} />

If the device already has a 48 bit MAC address, the 64 bit device identifier is formed by prepending
`0xff` and appending `0xfe`. For example, if the MAC address is `11:22:33:44:55:66`, the device
identifier should be `0xff112233445566fw`.

As for the length of identifiers,
it's theoretically possible for a device ID collision to occur in a small network of say 200 devices.
With evenly distributed (ie., random) device IDs and 1 trillion such networks 
the probability of collision in at least one of them is 0.1%.
OTOH, were we to use 32 bit IDs, with 2000 networks the collision probability in any of them
is already 1%, and with 200k networks it's more than 60%.

### Direction of packets

The JACDAC frames contain only one device identifier (a not source and destination, as in IP).
* if lowest frame flag bit is set, we call all packets in that frame _command packets_ and the device identifier is the destination
* otherwise, the packets in frame are _report packet_ and the device identifier is the source

### Multicast commands

Additionally, if the third bit of frame flags is set (_multicast commands_),
the low order 32 bits of device identifier are treated as service class.
The command is then directed to all services with that service class.

### ACKs

If a frame is received by the control layer, and is then routed correctly,
an ACK may need to be sent.
This only applies when frame contains command packets,
device identifier equals our device identifier,
and the second bit of frame flags is set.

ACK packet uses our device identifier, service number of `0x3f`,
and uses the CRC of the packet being acknowledged as the service command.
The payload is zero-sized.

All devices, except for the most resource-constrained bootloaders,
should be able to send ACKs.
They should indicate that in their advertisement packet.

### Pipes

Pipes are application-level mechanism for establishing reliable one- and two-way 
point-to-point data links.

Typical packet loss in JACDAC networks is well under 1%.
Anything that can withstand such packet loss **should not** be done over a pipe,
as pipes have quite big overhead.

Typical applications where pipes should be used:
* a WiFi service, where the pipe represents a TCP connection
* when a response to a command doesn't fit in one packet (eg. WiFi scan results)
* when events need to be delivered reliably (eg., RFID reader)

Pipes should generally not be used for:
* streaming sensor data (sensor events are OK)
* video data
* audio data

The way to initially establish a pipe depends on service, but typically
device A would send a command to device B to establish a pipe.
Device A would include its device identifier and _port_
(a 9 bit number of A's choosing; there would normally be one port per pipe) in the command.
If a two-way communication is desired, device B could then state the port on its side.

Both devices can then start sending commands to their respective ports.
The pipe commands use a fixed service number of `0x3e` and set the require-ACK
flag on frames.
The service command is split as follows:

| Bits  | Description
|------:| ------------------------------------
|   4:0 | Wrap around packet counter
|   6:5 | Content type
|  15:7 | Port number

The packet counter starts at `0x0` goes up to `0x1f`, and then back to `0x0`.
Rationale: there can be up to 30 non-empty packets in a frame.

Content type is:
* `0` for regular pipe data
* `1` for regular pipe data after which the pipe is to be closed
* `2` for service-specific out-of-band meta-data
* `3` is reserved

The sending protocol is:
* wait for any data that needs to be sent over the pipe
* send it as a command; wait for ACK
* if we timeout waiting for ACK, repeat previous step
* if we repeated 10 times already, close the pipe
* increment the pipe counter
* go back to the first step

The wait for ACK should follow exponential back-off, starting with 1ms up to 1024ms.

The receiving protocol keeps a counter for each pipe. This counter starts at 0.
* when a pipe command is received, ACK it (this is usually done generically, not only for pipes)
* if stored counter for pipe doesn't match the counter in the packet, drop the packet
* increment stored counter
* process data in packet
* repeat

The protocol above has an effective window of 1.
The counter allows increasing that up to 31, but this would require dealing with 
multiple packets per frame and is currently out of scope.

Pipes should be considered closed when the device at the other end resets.

TODO: Zero-length pipe commands can be sent as keep-alive packets.
Is this needed? 

Note that pipes are transmit streams of JACDAC packets, not streams of bytes.
They should not be recombined at any layer in the implementation.
For example, a command that returns a list of things can send each thing in a separate
pipe packet, without any additional info about how to chunk the data
(provided each thing fits in a packet).
Multiple packets can be grouped in a frame, but are still handled separately at the
destination.

### Event subscriptions

A device like accelerometer can send events eg. when a 2g shock is detected,
when it's moved face-down, etc.
These events a normally just broadcast on the bus, using standard command `0x001`.

For reliable event delivery, a pipe can be established, and events delivered
over that pipe.
