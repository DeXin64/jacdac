At a high level, JACDAC is a bus of devices, where each device can advertise the set of services it provides. A service is specified by a strongly-typed interface and abstracts the process of communicating with a JACDAC device via packets. A packet encapsulates the JACDAC information, which includes a 64-bit device identifier and data payload. Finally, at the lowest-level of the JACDAC stack, a serial wire protocol is used to transmit JACDAC packets between physical devices on the same JACDAC bus. JACDAC packets may also be sent over WebUSB, providing connectivity to virtual JACDAC devices and services running in the web browser.
