# Control layer

Every JACDAC device has a unique 64 bit identifier.
It may be generated from hardware unique ID (through hashing if needed;
we recommend [FNV1A](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-eastlake-fnv-14#section-3)).
Alternatively, it may be generated at first run using randomness and stored in flash or EPROM.

Another option is to flash a randomly generated 64 bit number during production.
If that is difficult, generate 48 bit (or so) random number, and assign identifiers
starting with that number with lowest bits incrementing.
Make sure to machine-generate the number, do not just bang on the keyboard.
You can use the line at the bottom of [CF2 patcher](https://microsoft.github.io/uf2/patcher/)
to generate random numbers.

If the device already has a 48 bit MAC address, the 64 bit device identifier is formed by prepending
`0xff` and appending `0xfe`. For example, if the MAC address is `11:22:33:44:55:66`, the device
identifier should be `0xFF112233445566FE`.

It's theoretically possible for a device ID collision to occur in a small network of say 200 devices.
With evenly distributed (ie., random) device IDs and 1 trillion such networks 
the probability of collision in any of them is 0.1%.
OTOH, were we to use 32 bit IDs, with 2000 networks the collision probability in any of them
is already 1%, and with 200k networks it's more than 60%.

## Direction of packets

The JACDAC frames contain only one device identifier.
* if lowest frame flag bit is set, we call all packets in that frame _command packets_ and the device identifier is the destination
* otherwise, the packets in frame are _report packet_ and the device identifier is the source

## Multicast commands

Additionally, is the third bit of frame flags is set (_multicast commands_),
the low order 32 bits of device identifier contain service class.
The command is then directed to all services with that service class.

## Services

Services in JACDAC are similar to services like telnet, HTTP, or SMTP in TCP/IP.
Each device can expose zero or more of these.
A service instance is uniquely identified by device identifier and 6 bit service number.
This also maps to a 32 bit service class.

Devices periodically advertise services they provide.
This advertisement lists all service classes in order of their respective service numbers.

For example, a device A may advertise the that it exposes the following services:
* control (0)
* accelerometer (1)
* magnetometer (2)
* LED strip (3)
* LED strip (4)
One can then send command packets with device identifier of A and service number of 2 to reach
the magnetometer service on A, for example to enable streaming of readings.
The readings would then similarly arrive with device identifier of A and service
number of 2, but as reports.
The same service class can occur more than once, in the example above the device might have
two connectors for LED strips.

When device advertises, the control service has to always reside at service number zero.

Service classes have format `0x1xxxxxxx`, except for control service which has service class of `0x00000000`.
If you create new service, the `xxxxxxx` should be randomly generated.

## Advertisement report packets

Advertisement are sent approximately every 500ms.

The service command is 0.
The payload is an array of unsigned 32 bit integers that represent service classes.
The position in the array is the service number.
For services that are missing or disabled use `0xffffffff`.

The first word of advertisement data would logically contain the class of the control
service, which is zero.
Instead, the first word is used to communicate critical information about the device
advertising itself.

| Bits  | Description
|------:| ------------------------------------
|   3:0 | Reset detection counter
|   7:4 | Reserved, keep as 0
|     8 | Device can send ACKs (see below)
|  31:9 | Reserved, keep as 0

The reset detection counter starts at `1` (not `0`) on the first advertisement packet
sent after reset. 
`2` is used for the second, and so on.
Once `15` is reached, all following advertisement packets use `15`.

If a device detects that the counter in advertisements packets of another device
decreases, it can infer that that other device went through reset
(and for example needs to be re-configured).


## ACKs

If a frame is received by the control layer, and is then routed correctly,
an ACK may need to be sent.
This only applies when frame contains command packets,
device identifier equals our device identifier,
and the second bit of frame flags is set.

ACK packet uses our device identifier, service number of `0x3f`,
and uses the CRC of the packet being acknowledged as the service command.
The payload is zero-sized.

All devices, except for the most resource-constrained bootloaders,
should be able to send ACKs.
They should indicate that in their advertisement packet.
