# Frames and Packets

All data is little endian.

A JACDAC frame contains one or more JACDAC packets.

```c
struct _jd_frame_t {
    uint16_t frame_crc;
    uint8_t frame_size;
    uint8_t frame_flags;

    uint64_t device_identifier;

    uint8_t data[JD_SERIAL_PAYLOAD_SIZE + 4]; // the actual size is frame_size, this is max
} __attribute__((__packed__, aligned(4)));
typedef struct _jd_frame_t jd_frame_t;
```

|Offset | Size | Description
|------:|-----:| ------------------------------------
|     0 |    2 | CRC-16-CCITT of all following data
|     2 |    1 | size of the payload (`data[]` field), `N`
|     3 |    1 | frame flags
|     4 |    8 | device identifier
|    12 |  `N` | payload

Total size of the frame is thus `N + 12`.
The CRC covers all data from byte 2 on, in both header and payload,
and it is typical [CRC-16-CCITT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)
(there is an efficient implementation in this repo, and it's also often supported
by hardware).

Packets have the following format:

|Offset | Size | Description
|------:|-----:| ------------------------------------
|     0 |    1 | size of data, `M`
|     1 |    1 | service number
|     2 |    2 | service command
|     4 |  `M` | data

Packets are layed out in the `data[]` field of the frame.
They are padded so they start at 4 byte boundary (ie., there is no padding if `M` is divisible by 4).
The frame header (including `device_identifier`) is **not** repeated.

The packets logically share the `device_identifier` and `flags`.
Typically, packets are uncompressed in place, and the following structure is used
to handle them.

```c
struct _jd_packet_t {
    uint16_t frame_crc;
    uint8_t frame_size;
    uint8_t frame_flags;

    uint64_t device_identifier;

    uint8_t service_size;
    uint8_t service_number;
    uint16_t service_command;

    uint8_t data[JD_SERIAL_PAYLOAD_SIZE]; // the actual size is service_size, this is max
} __attribute__((__packed__, aligned(4)));
typedef struct _jd_packet_t jd_packet_t;
```

To keep the total size of packet under `255` (which is DMA limit on some hardware)
and aligned to 4, `JD_SERIAL_PAYLOAD_SIZE` is `236`.
